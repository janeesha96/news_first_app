about the app,

this is a news app
multiple user can regiter to this app,
before login user should register in the first time.. then user dont need to register
i could not intergrate the fileter option and top search option becouse of the time limitation.

in the progile tab user can sign out and rederected to the login page. 
if user logged, everytime when the app open user directed to the dashbord.

thank you,
